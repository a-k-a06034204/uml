## Overview
This report reviews recent research provided in the research journal “Structural and Mechanistic Insights into the Transport of Aristolochic Acids and their Active Metabolites by Human Serum Albumin” by Karen Fleming and the members of the JBC Editorial Board. This is research important because while Aristolochic acids I and II (AA-I/II) are known carcinogenic principles of the Aristolochia plant, they may be used to treat several human conditions, chronic conditions, and may be used for the development of drugs/drug discovery.
